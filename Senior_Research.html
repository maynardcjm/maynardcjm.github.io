        <h3>Introduction of Research Topic</h3>
    
       Lately, there has been a demand for browsers which prevent online tracking. Mozilla Firefox is one such web browser which strives at protecting its users' privacy. People claim anonymity on the internet is dead. Why might this be? One reason to support this claim lies in the way companies can target users' with personalized ads. There are signs that certain apps listen to users' through there phone. Talk about catfood, catfood, catfood, and magically poof on Facebook there's an advertisement for catfood. As magically wonderful this technology is. It reveals a threat to users who wish to maintain their privacy on the web.

        Through my research I found there to be three main tracking mechanisms popular on the web: <br>
        1) Third-party Cookies <br>
        2) Canvas Fingerprinting <br>
        3) Web Beacon <br><br>
        
    <h3>Summary of Research</h3>
  
    Currently, for my research time has only permitted to examine Third-party Cookies. To observe the behaviors of third-party cookies the raw data stored on the computer's hard drive was observed. Five websites of each category was observed. The categories were .edu, .gov, .net, .com, and .org websites. The main attributes observed of the cookies were expiration time, creation time, and last accessed time. The data of these three times appear in a unix timestamp format. The difference in expiration time and creation time determined the lifetime of the cookie. The idea is that if cookies last an absurd amount of time that they were potentially more invasive to privacy. The data was collected from the sql file and then exported to a text file. From there python scripts were created to calculate the lifetime and convert the unix timestamps into legible time.
